# 1 + 1 = 1


But what does it actually mean to add two numbers? Can we somehow morph the definition of $$+$$ to make $$1 + 1 = 1$$?

## Church Numerals

In the 1930s, Alonzo Church introduced us to lambda calculus, a computation model that can simulate any Turing machine, thereby rendering it Turing complete. At its core, the lambda calculus consists of the following primitives:
- Variables or terms (eg: $$x$$, $$y$$)
- Lambdas of the form ($$\lambda x . y$$)
- Application ($$x y$$), where $$x$$ and $$y$$ are lambdas

We can compose these primitives to build some higher level abstractions. For example, we can encode booleans as follows:
```
TODO
```

A natural progression would then be to try to encode numerals using this calculi. This is where Church Numerals comes into play. Church Numerals are a way of encoding natural numbers in the lambda calculus. Formally speaking, a Church Numeral is a lambda where TODO insert definition.

If we take `0` to be the zero element, and define a lambda `S` called a successor, we can encode numbers as follows:
```
O
S O
S S O
S S S O
S ... n times O
```

### Implementation in Coq

We define an inductive type to represent the zero element `O` and the successor lambda `S`.
```coq
Inductive nat : Type :=
    | O
    | S (n : nat).
```

### Definition of add
```coq
