<div class="content">
    <p>
    I'm an undergrad studying Computer Science at <a href="{{ gatech.main }}">Georgia Tech</a>. My interests include operating systems, compilers, functional programming, web development, and all things Rust!
    </p>

    <p>
    I enjoy hacking on <span class="accent">open source projects {% emoji "⚙️" %}</span>, <span class="accent">speed cubing {% emoji "⌛" %}</span>, <span class="accent">origami {% emoji "💮" %}</span>, and <span class="accent">reading books {% emoji "📚" %}</span>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I currently work with <a href="{{ gatech.hackgt.main }}">HackGT</a> as a tech team member, where I help throw one of the biggest hackathons in the south. I'm also a teaching assistant for CS 2110 (Computer Systems and Architecture).
    </p>

    <p>
    In the past, I've interned at <a href="{{ work.ncr }}">NCR</a>. I was an event lead for <a href="{{ gatech.hackgt.horizons }}">Horizons</a>, which is an arts + tech hackathon that catered to over 300 hackers, and led to some really interesting projects.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can find my projects on <a href="{{ work.github }}">github</a>
